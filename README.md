## Goals / Questions
What are the pros and cons of each language we might use?
What are the goals we want to achieve with this project overall?

## Ideas
* [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org) Java critters on a grid 
   * (Pros: get a grid for free)
   * [Has article about TDD in Greenfoot](https://greenroom.greenfoot.org/files/740/original.pdf)
   * (Cons: Do we want a grid? Or at least 3D space?)
* [Have Java output charts](https://www.fromdev.com/2012/09/Free-Open-Source-Java-Charting-Library.html)
* give ctreatures line-of-sight vision
* give creatures a nose


## Currently Doing
- [ ] designing tests
- [ ] writing code
- [ ] designing a brain

## Needs to be Done

## Already Finished
- [x] Aaron needs to fill out a project sheet for Michelle.
- [x] choosing a language

## Bug List
- JavaFX sometimes stops displaying simulation when frame rate is too fast

## Areas of Further Study
- Would more realistic DNA expression (dominance and recessive etc. vs. averages, multiple factors) help cooler things evolve?
- Brains ... Language ... Culture?
