## Goals / Questions
What are the pros and cons of each language we might use?
What are the goals we want to achieve with this project overall?

## Ideas
* [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org) Java critters on a grid 
   * (Pros: get a grid for free) 
   * (Cons: can we have tests? Do we want a grid? Or at least 3D space?)
